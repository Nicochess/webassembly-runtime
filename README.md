<p>I created this project to make your development experience better, with some pre-configuration to you getting started as fast as possible.</p>
<p>To use this, just clone into your computer and edit the name of the files where there "boilerplate-react-app".</p>

```
git clone https://github.com/Nicochess/boilerplate-react-app.git
```

<sup>I decided to create this project because I was so angry that Create-React-App became slow.</sup>  <br>
<sup>My aplication **suddenly** started to take 3-5 minutes to run.</sup>  <br>
<sup>I was happy when hot reload took 10ms.</sup>  <br>
<sup>That's all, sad programmer coding in a dawn.</sup>  <br>
